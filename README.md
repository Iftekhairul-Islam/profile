## [Dhaka City Digital Map- First of it's Kind!!!](http://analytixbd.com/)
This is the very first digital visualization of Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh. It would not only help the government organizations like city corporation for assessing and collecting tax, fire department for emergency evacuation and disaster management, police department to pinpoint high crime areas, RAJUK for illegal development control, BBS for the census but also this digital technology would assist private sectors with real-time market survey, real estate valuation and rental price, finding suitable locations for social amenities and business setups or comparing living conditions of different areas.

## [Impact of AI and ML algorithms on Employment: A State-level Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.02783)
In this analysis I have used unsupervised learning approach (K-medoid Clustering) to detect how the prospect of some mid-level jobs have been declining for the last several years, and what would be the state-level exposure in terms of unemployment.

## [Application of Remotely Sensed (RS) data to monitor SDG](https://www.thedailystar.net/opinion/news/using-satellites-get-the-real-picture-development-1915501)
In this newpaper article I proposed a gudeline how Bangladesh could take advantage of Satellite imagery and RS data to evaluate and acheive its SDG in acosteffective and efficient manner

Here, I have used areal interpolation (Kriging) to get precinct level demographics, income, racial data from the census block groups and run RandomForest algorithm to detect the most important attributes that influence voting choice in 2016 Presidential election in Dallas and Harris counties.

## [Dhaka: An Urban Journey Towards Doom](https://medium.com/@iftekharshajib/dhaka-an-urban-journey-towards-doom-4655679192fb)
In this satellite-image analysis, I detect how the urbanization trajectory of Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh, took a nose-dive in the last 20 years.
